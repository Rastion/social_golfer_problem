    Social Golfer Problem

    In a social golfer setting, a club organizes play over several weeks.
    Each week the golfers are divided into groups of equal size. The goal is
    to schedule the groups over the weeks such that any pair of golfers meets
    at most once (or, equivalently, to minimize redundant meetings beyond the first).

    Instance File Format:
      - Three integers on a single line:
          nb_groups  group_size  nb_weeks
      - The total number of golfers is nb_groups * group_size.

    Decision Variables:
      A candidate solution is represented as a list of length nb_weeks.
      Each element (week) is a list of nb_groups groups (each a list of golfer indices).
      In a valid solution, each week every golfer (from 0 to nb_golfers-1) appears exactly once.

    Objective:
      Minimize the total number of redundant meetings. For each unordered pair of golfers,
      if they are scheduled to meet in the same group more than once, each meeting beyond
      the first is counted as a redundancy.
